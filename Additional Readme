This is a simple python program to see and read or even make temporary changes in the data-set.

Put the CSV wherever in your computer and don't forget to change the location of the read_csv command in the python file.

There are many places where the file is read so double check each line carefully else the program will throw an error.

The CSV file is attached along with a Report.
